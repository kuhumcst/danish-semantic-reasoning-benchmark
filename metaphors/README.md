This folder contains the metaphor dataset used in the paper: Pedersen et al. (forthcoming) Evaluating LLM-generated Explanations of Metaphors - A Culture-Sensitive Study of Danish. Nodalida 2025, and was developed by the Centre for Language Technology, UCPH and The Society for Danish Language and Literature. 
The dataset consists of 150 Danish metaphors, 75 single word metaphors and 75 fixed multiword expression metaphors. For each of these parts of the dataset, 25 metaphors are cross cultural, i.e. they exist in English as well as in Danish, whereas the other 50 metaphors are culture specific, meaning they exist in Danish, but not in English - though they might exist in other languages.  
Two large language models, ChatGPT4o mini and LLama3.1 405B, were prompted in both English and Danish, with the data in isolation and in context. The results were evaluated by experts on a four-grade scale. The prompts used are included in this dataset, so that the experiment can be rerun. If you want access to the answers of the LLMs in the performed experiment and the evaluations, please write to saolsen @ hum.ku.dk.
The single word metaphors with definitions, POS, context and explanations of the four-grade scale are found in: DanishSingleWordMetaphors.xlsx. The fixed expressions in: DanishFixedExpressions.xlsx.
The queries for the experiments are found in: Queries_DanishSingleWordMethaphors.xlsx and in Queries_DanishFixedExpressions.xlsx.
